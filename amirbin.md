Heyyyy boy,

I was so lucky to get to know you, we we're at last row of CE's site and I was playing GTA Online and Abolfazl introduced us to each other.

You know what is best about you? You love people around you and that's why everyone is is love with you. Don't stop loving!

And you told me you give people your PS2 to help them experience Metal Gear Solid :)

I hope you priceless smiles and wish a fun life ahead of you.
